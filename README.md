### Hi there 👋

I am a chatty PhD student who touches 🐟 a lot. Below are some logistics about this account:

### Star the Repos, Rather than Following the Accounts

I plan to make this account a 0-following one. I feel it weird that I cannot customize the timeline on my dashboard as I expect; and it is overwhelming to see all those operation-generated information, i.e. who forks/watches/follows/commits xxx, rather than human-curated messages, i.e. milestones, or product annoucement. I decide to make a rule for myself on Github, i.e. 

**Keep this account as a 0-following one. Whenever I want to follow someone, look for one of his/her repo which interests me to star instead. If I cannot find one repo to star, then why should I follow him/her?
**

Maybe this is a good practice of "对事不对人" and not to FOMO.
